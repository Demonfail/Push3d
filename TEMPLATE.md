A collection of useful scripts/shaders/objects for GameMaker Studio 2. Just scroll down a bit and see for yourself what you can grab ;) Also, you gain no financial obligations towards me for using anything from this repo, but if you want to show either your appreciation or hate, you can just throw some coins at my face on https://www.paypal.me/kraifpatrik/1USD!
